# YSDA Natural Language Processing course

- [week01](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/nlp_course/blob/2020/week01_embeddings) **Word Embeddings**
  
  - [homework](https://github.com/GoshaTraksel/NLP_course/tree/main/week01_embeddings)

  - For my first week homework, I worked with natural language processing. We managed to build a machine translation model without using a deep neural network and other interesting things. Two related Slavic languages were chosen for the model: Ukrainian and Russian.   

  - [week02](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/nlp_course/blob/2020/week02_classification) **Text Classification**
